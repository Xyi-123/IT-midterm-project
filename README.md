Using regression modeling to identify key trading signals

# Financial Signal Analysis & Trading Strategy Research：

## 1. Data Exploration & Feature Engineering
- Compute descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) to analyze the relationship between signals and returns.
- Apply signal binning, interaction terms, and trend analysis to extract key features that may impact returns.

## 2️. Multi-Day Return Regression Modeling
- Build regression models for different time horizons (1-day, 2-day, 3-day, 5-day returns).
- Use Lasso regression to select the most predictive signals and analyze their influence weights.

## 3️. Signal Importance Analysis & Summary of Findings
- Identify which signals are most useful for predicting returns and trend reversals, providing a foundation for trading strategy design.
